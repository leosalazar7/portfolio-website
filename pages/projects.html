            <h3>
                This silly website | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub
            </h3>
            <p1 class="project-paragraph">
                learned how to use html, css, and javascript to develop my own website. 
                currently using it as a portfolio website to showcase my lackluster self.
                also learned how to host my website using github.
                learned git commands so that i can edit the code from vscode and push the edits to my github repository and update the website.

            <h3>
                Study Room Booking Script | Python, Selenium
            </h3>
            <p1 class="project-paragraph">
                made a python script to auto book a study room.
                runs on a scheduler so that i don't have to stay up late every night booking the room.
                books the room faster than i manually could, so i don't have to worry about losing the room to the competition.

            <h3>
                Checkers Game | C
            </h3>
            <p1 class="project-paragraph">
                made a silly checkers game in intro to C.
                im pretty proud of it because it's the first time i've ever made something so complicated.
                even tho it isn't perfect, it's pretty fleshed out and allows for two players to play on one device.

            <h3>
                Snake Game | Java, JFrame
            </h3>
            <p1 class="project-paragraph">
                made a snake game in java using jframe.
                the snake starts at a certain size and grows by one every time you eat an apple.
                keeps track of the score at the top of the screen.
                if you hit the borders or yourself, ends the game and shows you your final score.

            <h3>
                Calculator App | Java, JFrame
            </h3>
            <p1 class="project-paragraph">
                made a simple 4 function calculator app in java using jframe.
                looks similar to a standard calculator app found on phones.
                performs math operations and displays results on screen.
